# Discurs.eu - AI-Assisted Rational Discourse Platform

## Overview
Discurs.eu is an AI-assisted platform designed to enhance rational discourse by providing fact-checking, logic analysis, and argument structure evaluation. The project is currently in its prototyping phase, using **Streamlit** for rapid development and deployment.

## Features
- **Chat-Based Interface**: Modeled after common messaging apps, providing an intuitive user experience.
- **Three AI Interventions**:
  - üßê **Fact-Check**: AI verifies statements against available sources.
  - üß† **Logic Check**: AI analyzes logical coherence and identifies fallacies.
  - üìñ **Argument Structure**: AI evaluates clarity, coherence, and completeness of statements.
- **AI Flagging System**:
  - AI passively marks potentially misleading statements.
  - Users can request an explanation for flagged content.
- **Discussion Modes**:
  - **Agora**: Open discussion with minimal AI moderation.
  - **Forum**: Structured, long-form discussions.
  - **Lab**: AI-assisted structured debate and synthesis.
